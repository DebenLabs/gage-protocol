/// @notice The idle-cash reserve a testnet Earn strategy parks USDG in: a plain ERC-4626 vault over test USDG.
///         It stands in for the curated Morpho vault the mainnet strategy uses, because no such vault exists on
///         testnet. It is NOT Morpho, shares no code with Morpho, and must never be presented as one.
/// @dev NEVER deploy this on chain 4663. Yield is not earned here; `accrue` pulls USDG from a caller that chooses
///      to donate it, so a testnet can show a share price that moves. Deposits and withdrawals are otherwise
///      unrestricted, which is the behaviour HybridVault's happy path assumes.
///      Anyone can move this reserve's share price, by `accrue` or by a bare transfer, because the test USDG it
///      holds is free to mint. That is inherent to a faucet testnet and is not a finding: no balance here is worth
///      anything. Never read a share price from this contract as evidence about the mainnet reserve.
